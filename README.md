# Guided Project: Visualizing the Gender Gap in College Degrees

[DataQuest's](http://dataquest.io/) guided project to practice data visualization using Pandas and matplotlib.

[The Department of Education Statistics](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp) releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

In this project, we will generate line charts to visualize the gender gap across all degree categories.
